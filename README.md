Powerlifting Totals 2002-2022

In this project I inspect Powerlifting Totals for year 2002 to 2022. A Total is the combined weight of the Squat, Bench and Deadlift for a competitor at a competition.
The daatset is available at: https://www.openpowerlifting.org/
The dataset was downloaded in January 2023.
